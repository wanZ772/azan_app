Novel Dear Mr Kilmer : Moral Values

Respect and love for family members

â€“ Richard and Gus are different in nature but the father loves them. They try to earn his respect by doing what he wants them to do. But the father understands that each son is different.

â€“ Roland and his brother are different in personality too but Knight loves his brother and still feels the pain of losing his brother in a war. Richard shows his love for his sister by helping her.

â€“ The Schermers love each other. They worry that Otto is in the army and may get killed.

Respect human beings

Everyone should be respected despite racial or religious differences. Vandalising property, judging people by the language they speak or their cultural habits is unfair and ignorant.

Compassion

â€“ Richard displays compassion for the underdog and the victims of prejudice. He reaches out to Hannah because she is treated badly by their classmates and also the town. He refuses to be part of the meanness that makes Hannah decline the position of Lady Liberty.

â€“ He is kind to his sister as he feels that she looks tired and needs help.

â€“ Mrs. Hansen shows compassion for Hannah and what she goes through in life.

â€“ Hannah believes that hatred and prejudices have no place in this world. She believes that people must care for people without thinking of race, religion or nationality. Compassion plays a big part in making people become better and more caring people.

Patriotism

Kilmer joins the army to show his love for his country. Otto enlists even though he is of German origin out of loyalty to the land he lives in. Gus too joins the army because he thinks it is his duty to fight for the country. Roland who had joined earlier had been killed in the war against the Spanish. Suffering and death are natural results of any war.
